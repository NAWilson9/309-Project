## Project setup
Steps to get the project up and running.
1. Ensure you have a compatible version of Node.js installed (^6.9.0)
2. Run `npm install` from the root of the project directory.
3. Create a copy of the `config_template.json` file, name it `config.json`, and populate the fields.
4. Do the same for any other necessary config files (I.E in the connector directories).
5. Run the server by calling `node $path/to/server.js`.
